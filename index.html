              <h3> &lt; Programming passion &gt;</Programming></h3>
              <p>
                Programming became my passion, I prefer coding than watching
                movies or even reading, which I love.
              </p>
              <p>
                Someone once told me that <b>reading code is like reading a novel</b>, and there is indeed
                something in that. I also love writing (as an example you've
                seen my article on previous slide) so
                <b>now I'm writing my own coding novels</b> - I create
                characters that have impact on each other, their paths merge and
                then separate after the mission is accomplished. Sometimes they
                wait until the other is ready. Novels must have an introduction,
                a development and an ending - the introduction of the characters
                at the beginning, then the action and finally the obligatory
                happy ending without any unresolved conflicts ;)
              </p>
              <p>And, of course, the conduct of the story must not be convoluted so that the reader doesn't get lost ;)</p>

        <p>Everyone says my passion for programming is contagious and one IT specialist said that he would probably go in programming direction 
          if even one lecturer at university talked about programming in such a way. Now he's even thinking about exloring a programming language because

        <p>This is linked to the fact that I have a gift for making people curious abuot what I'm passionate about - in the same way that my 
          speech about architecture at an academic conference was met with great acclaim (conference about curiosities in literature).
