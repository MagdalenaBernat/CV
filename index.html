              curiosity became passion, when faced with a choice of watching a
              film or reading a book, I choose to write code or read
              documentation or read about fields of IT I'm interrested in

              Hi! I'm Magda and I'm fullstack developer. I have a childlike joy
              of learning and discovering new things. The ability to think
              analytically allows me to break down problems into smaller tasks
              and find step-by-step solutions

              Everyone says my passion for programming is contagious and one IT
              specialist said that he would probably go in programming direction
              if even one lecturer at university talked about programming in
              such a way. Now he's even thinking about exloring a programming
              language because I made him curious about the subject. I have such
              a gift abou

            <p>
              This is linked to the fact that I have a gift for making people
              curious abuot what I'm passionate about - in the same way that my
              speech about architecture at an academic conference was met with
              great acclaim (conference about curiosities in literature).
              Everyone wanted to listen longer :)

          <h3>&lt; Programming passion &gt;</h3>
          <p>
            Programming became my passion, I prefer coding than watching movies
            or even reading, which I love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Someone once told me that
            <b>reading code is like reading a novel</b>, and there is indeed
            something in that. I also love writing (as an example you've seen my
            article on previous slide) so
            <b>now I'm writing my own coding novels</b> - I create characters
            that have impact on each other, their paths merge and then separate
            after the mission is accomplished. Sometimes they wait until the
            other is ready. Novels must have an introduction, a development and
            an ending - the introduction of the characters at the beginning,
            then the action and finally the obligatory happy ending without any
            unresolved conflicts ;)
          </p>
          <p>
            And, of course, the conduct of the story must not be convoluted so
            that the reader doesn't get lost ;)
